    Time and money shouldn't go to waste, especially on guide books that waste precious space telling you things you don't need, or generic advice that applies to all courses, but are useful to no one.

      I’m a student from Singapore, and studying law at Oxford had always been a dream of mine. I scored fairly averagely in the International Baccalaureate, borrowed and bought all the admission and LNAT guide books I could, and was rejected by Oxford and LSE on my first try. Oxford, LSE, UCL, KCL and Durham accepted my second application.
      </p> 
      <p class = 'lead'>
      This book details what I learnt in the intervening year between my applications. Not everyone gets a second try at Oxbridge and the likes, so in this book, I will waste no time telling you everything I did wrong my first go around, and everything right in my second so you'll only need one chance. Focusing on passion over academics in my personal statement, doing the wrong LNAT practices, spending too much time preparing what was not asked in the interview - I'm here to make sure you don't do any of that, but instead spend your time engaging in useful preparation.\
      </p>
      <p class = 'lead'>
      I list and explain the components of a good personal statement, provide example statement, explain how to prepare for the LNAT and acquire quality practices for free, provide a depository of likely Oxbridge interview questions and possible answers to them, and detail my personal experiences with these components so you know what to expect.
      </p>
      <p class = 'lead'>
      For Oxbridge hopefuls, I provide some admission tips - the famous Oxford-Cambridge cycle, applying to some colleges over others, international students college selection rumours etc.
      </p>
      <p class = 'lead'>
      Note: Since my experience comprises a majority of the book, it focuses on school's I'm familiar with - Oxford, Cambridge LSE, UCL, KCL, Durham, Warwick, Edinburgh etc. Note that since I've never taken the Cambridge Law Test, it will not be covered.
